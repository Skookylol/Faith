    <!-- About God Section -->
    <section id="about" class="section light-background">
        <h2>About God</h2>
        <p>God is the eternal Creator of the universe, the One who spoke the heavens and the earth into existence. He is the source of all life, love, and goodness. His presence fills the universe, and His power sustains all creation.</p>
        <p>God is a Trinity—one God in three persons: Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit. This mystery reveals the relational nature of God: He is a God of love and community within Himself.</p>
        <p>Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was sent to Earth to reveal God's love for humanity. Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus made a way for us to be reconciled to God. By accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior, we are offered eternal life and the promise of salvation.</p>
        <p>The Holy Spirit, who dwells within believers, guides us into all truth, comforts us in times of trouble, and empowers us to live holy lives. God is always near, desiring a personal relationship with each of us, offering us grace, forgiveness, and abundant life.</p>
        <h3>God's Nature</h3>
        <p>God is unchanging, faithful, and trustworthy. He is just and righteous in all His ways, yet merciful and compassionate. His love is unconditional, and He desires that none should perish but that all come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). In God, we find the perfect balance of justice and mercy.</p>
        <p>In our journey with God, we are called to walk in His light, to grow in our faith, and to share His love with others. As we study His Word and seek Him in prayer, we come to understand more deeply who God is and His plan for our lives.</p>

        <h2>Scripture</h2>
        <p>The Bible, God’s Holy Word, is His revelation to humanity. It is inspired by the Holy Spirit and is the ultimate source of truth and guidance for our lives. Through Scripture, we come to know God more deeply, understand His will, and receive wisdom for daily living.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?” - Psalm 27:1</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.” - Proverbs 3:5-6</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.” - Jeremiah 29:11</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>

        <h3>Key Themes in Scripture</h3>
        <p>The Bible is filled with rich themes that reflect God’s character and His plan for humanity:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Sin and Redemption:</strong> Humanity's fall into sin and God's plan for salvation through Jesus Christ. (Romans 3:23, John 3:16)</li>
            <li><strong>Faith and Trust:</strong> The call to trust in God's promises, even when we cannot see the way forward. (Hebrews 11:1)</li>
            <li><strong>Love and Grace:</strong> God's love for us, demonstrated through His sacrifice on the cross. (Ephesians 2:8-9)</li>
            <li><strong>Eternal Life:</strong> The promise of eternal life for all who believe in Jesus Christ. (John 5:24)</li>
        </ul>
